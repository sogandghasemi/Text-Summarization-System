Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of humans or other living beings. It is a field of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines. Such machines may be called AIs. AI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile applications are: advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), interacting via human speech (such as Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative and creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (such as chess and Go).Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called Machine Intelligence. living beings.
